# Quick Hyperlink

Sometimes you just need to select some text and make it a link. With this, you can select text, press the shortcut, and it will create an anchor element wrapped around the selected text, and take whatever is in the clipbaord and set it as the `href` attribute.

To use it, select some text, hit `Ctrl` + `option` + L in Mac (`Ctrl` + `Alt` + L in Windows/PC), to make the selected text part of an anchor tag, with the `href` attribute containing the value of whatever was in the clipboard.
